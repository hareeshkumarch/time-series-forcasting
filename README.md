What is LSTM?
LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. Unlike traditional feedforward neural networks, LSTM networks have feedback connections that allow them to process entire sequences of data, making them well-suited for time series forecasting tasks.

Time Series Forecasting
Time series forecasting involves predicting future values based on past observations. This is applicable in various domains such as finance, weather forecasting, sales prediction, etc. LSTM networks are particularly effective for time series forecasting because they can learn from the temporal relationships present in the data.

How LSTM is Used for Time Series Forecasting:
Data Preparation: Time series data is preprocessed to create input-output pairs suitable for training the LSTM model. This may involve tasks like normalization, splitting into training/validation/test sets, etc.

Model Architecture: The LSTM model architecture is defined, including the number of layers, hidden units, activation functions, and other hyperparameters.

Training: The LSTM model is trained using historical time series data. During training, the model learns to capture patterns and relationships in the data that can be used for making future predictions.

Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), etc., on a validation dataset. This helps assess the model's performance and identify areas for improvement.

Forecasting: Once trained and evaluated, the LSTM model can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. These predictions can then be compared with actual values to assess the accuracy of the model.

Benefits of LSTM for Time Series Forecasting:
Ability to Capture Long-Term Dependencies: LSTM networks are capable of remembering information over long sequences, making them suitable for forecasting tasks where historical context is important.

Flexibility in Model Architecture: LSTM architectures can be customized based on the specific requirements of the forecasting task, allowing for experimentation with different configurations to achieve optimal performance.

Effective Handling of Sequential Data: LSTM networks excel at processing sequential data, making them well-suited for time series forecasting tasks where the order of data points matters.
